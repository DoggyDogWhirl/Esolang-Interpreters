  ^>  Output the value in the cell at the pointer
<v^   Sets the variable to the value in the cell at the pointer (the variable is set to 0 by default)
 v^>  Sets the value in the cell at the pointer to the variable
<  >  The next two commands are never run, and instead converted to a number which stored in the cell at the pointer (e.g. " v >" and " v^>" are converted to 01010111, and stored as 87)
< ^>  All commands between this command and its next instance are stored as a function and not run
<v >  Calls the function
<v^>  Halt the program (And starts the program; first line must be one)



Code looks like this:
<v^> #Cat program
<v
< ^
 v^
<v
 v >

Though because of the way the interpreter works, it could also look like this:
^<< >   CAts.   v
          v . < v
  ^<<       < ^<<
  ^   v
cat ? v<<
>>>>v   >>>>v

But that's a secret, don't tell the cops!
